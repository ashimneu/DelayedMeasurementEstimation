Recursive Bayesian estimation consists of time propagation for prediction of the state and measurement update to correct the predicted state.

The continuous time propagation model can be represented as
\begin{equation}
	\label{eqn:StateProp}
	\Boldx_{k+1} = \Boldf (\Boldx_k, \Boldu_k ) + \Boldomega_k
\end{equation}
where $\Boldx_k \in\mathbb{R}^n$ represents the state vector at discrete-time $k$, $\Boldu_k$ is the control input and $\Boldw_k$ is zero-mean, white, Gaussian process noise with covariance matrix $\BoldQ_k$. $\Boldf (\cdot)$ represents the relation for propagation of the system between successive time steps.
The measurement models are represented as
\begin{align} 
	\label{eqn:DelayedMeasurement}
	\Boldz_k &= \Boldh ( \Boldx_{k}, \Boldb_{k}, \tau_k ) + \Boldzeta_k \\
	\label{eqn:UndelayedMeasurement}
	\Boldy_k &= \Boldc ( \Boldx_k ) + \Boldeta_k,
\end{align}
where $\Boldz_k$ is a vector of delayed measurements affected by bias $\Boldb_k$, $\Boldy_k$ is a vector of measurements unaffected by the delay and $\tau_k = N$ is number of delay time steps.
$\Boldh(\cdot)$ and $\Boldc(\cdot)$ represent the relation between the system state and the measurements $\Boldz_k$ and $\Boldy_k$, respectively.
$\Boldzeta_k$ and $\Boldeta_k$ are zero-mean, white, Gaussian measurement noises with covariance matrices $\BoldR_k$ and $\BoldSigma_k$, respectively.
The covariance matrices $\BoldSigma_k$ and $\BoldR_k$ are assumed to be invertible and diagonal\footnote
{\label{ftnt:R_assumption}
	Note that there is no restriction attached to this assumption. The solution can be used for any  covariance matrix by using the transformation $\Boldy' =\BoldSigma_R  \, \Boldy$ with $\BoldR^{-1} = \BoldSigma_R \, \BoldSigma_R^\top$, the measurement model for $\Boldy'$ is:
	$$\Boldy'=\BoldH' \,\Boldx+\Boldeta' \mbox{ where } \BoldH' = \Sigma_R  \, \BoldH \mbox{ , } \Boldeta' \sim \mathcal{N}(\0,\,\BoldI).$$
}
, which can be written as $\BoldSigma = \sum_{i=1}^{m_d} \rho_{i}^2 \, \Bolde_i  \,{\Bolde_i}^\top$ and $\BoldR = \sum_{i=1}^{m_u} \sigma_{i}^2 \, \Bolde_i  \,{\Bolde_i}^\top$, respectively, where $\Bolde_i$ is the $i^{th}$ column of the identity matrix $\BoldI \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times m}$ .
The prior and measurement noise are independent.

The linear discrete-time form of the time propagation model of eqn. (\ref{eqn:StateProp}) can be represented as
\begin{align}
	\label{eqn:LinearStateProp}
	\Boldx_{k+1} &\doteq \BoldF \Boldx_k + \BoldGamma \Boldw_k.
\end{align}
The linear representations of the measurement models of eqns. (\ref{eqn:DelayedMeasurement}) and (\ref{eqn:UndelayedMeasurement}) are
\begin{align} \label{eqn:LinearDelayedMeasurement}
	\Boldz_k &\doteq \BoldH_{k-N} \Boldx_{k-N} + \Boldb_{k-N} +\Boldzeta_k \\
	\label{eqn:LinearUndelayedMeasurement}
	\Boldy_k &\doteq \BoldC_k \Boldx_k + \Boldeta_k,
\end{align}
where $\BoldH_{k-N} \in \mathbb{R}^{m_d \times n}$ is the measurement matrix that relates the delayed measurement $\Boldz_{k}$ to the state at time $k-N$, i.e. $\Boldx_{k-N}$. 
$\BoldC_k\in \mathbb{R}^{m_u \times n}$ is the measurement matrix that relates undelayed measurement $\Boldz_k$ to the state at time $k$, i.e. $\Boldx_k$ .

The measurement update at time step $k$ involves a state prior which is modeled as a Gaussian probability distribution $\Boldx_k \sim \mathcal{N}(\hat{\Boldx}_k^-,\BoldP_k^-)$, where the mean $\hat{\Boldx}_k^-$ and error covariance matrix $\BoldP_k^-$ are provided by the time propagation step.

The span of each time steps are assumed to be constant and denoted by $\tau$.
